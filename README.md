# OpenSanitizer
An open-source, low-cost, low resource and easy to build powerful UV Sanitizer to be used in hospitals, healthcare institutes or even homes. This machine is technically as effective as it's off-the-shelf counterparts. 
A UV Sanitizer can be used in a hospital to sterilize tools and equipment such as respirators, surgical instruments, invasive tubings, etc. But with the emergence of COVID-19 pandemic and the shortage of masks and other perishables, the sanitizer can also be used to sanitize and reuse some of the equipment used in healthcare centers to fight the Corona Virus. 
Please refer to the Wiki Page for more information.
